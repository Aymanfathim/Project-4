                    The blue green waters off the south east coast of Australia glisten as the sun rises above the
                    horizon. Up early and eager, local fishermen brave the choppy seas as they collect their daily
                    yield. Dedicated to preservation, they work extra hard to follow environmentally sustainable fishing
                    practices – including avoiding overfishing, staying clear of </p>
                <p class="tall-fish-w-content">protected areas, releasing protected
                    species, and using safe fishing gear. As they arrive back at the docks, the huge array of fresh
                    seafood is put on ice and shipped directly to Sea Harvest’s door in Canberra. Oysters, prawns,
                    mussels, calamari, lobster, snapper, and every seasonal fish available travels straight from sea to
                    store, just for you. </p>

            <p class="main3-w-content"> The Sea Harvest story begins in the 1800s on a small, picturesque fishing island
                called Lefkada in
                Greece. For generations since, our love of the sea and taste for seafood has endured, following us to
                Canberra where we settled in the 1970s. For over 40 years now, we have dedicated ourselves to offering
                the finest and freshest Australian seafood at the best prices. </p>
